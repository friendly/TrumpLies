Trump: ""One of the greatest in the history of our country.""","There is no way in which the economy's performance during the first 10 months of Trump's tenure constitutes one of the greatest economic ""revivals"" in American history. Economists say U.S. economic performance in 2017 has been broadly consistent with the post-recession revival that began under Obama. More jobs were created during the same period in 2016, under Obama, than during the first 10 months of Trump's tenure: 1.78 million under Obama, 1.47 million under Trump, Washington Post economics reporter Heather Long noted. Trump presided over two consecutive quarters of 3 per cent economic growth, which is considered good, but as a Brookings Institution report in 2013 noted, the recessions of 1974-1975 and the early 1980s were followed by ""annual GDP growth around 5 per cent in 1976-78 and even higher in 1983-85.""

But his history is off: growth in bank loans to companies boomed in the Obama years after the creation of the Bureau, but it has fallen to lower levels at least preliminarily under Trump. As the Wall Street Journal reported in October: ""Since President Donald Trump's election, bankers and investors predicted that pro-business policies would lead to a surge in corporate borrowing, which would help bank profits. Instead, the growth of loans to companies has dropped precipitously since last November -- to 2.1 per cent from 8.1 per cent, according to Federal Reserve data."" While some smaller community banks have indeed struggled in recent years, there is no evidence that the Bureau has been a significant cause. The Star contacted three experts who are critical of the Bureau to ask them for their thoughts on the veracity of Trump's claim; the one who responded said the claim is difficult to fact-check because it is so vague. Finally: it's worth noting that a new Bureau rule finalized in October places significant new restrictions on payday lenders, but it has not forced them out of business en masse to date.

Harold Holzer, chairman of the Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation from 2010 to 2016 and before that the chairman of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission for 10 years, said in an email: ""I concede, Trump has cut more regulations than Lincoln did. That's because Lincoln didn't cut ANY regulations and President Trump doesn't know what he's talking about. Might be worth noting that when Lincoln faced a budgetary shortfall he raised taxes, he didn't lower them...imposed the first federal income tax, in fact, and allowed for deductibility of state and local taxes so taxpayers wouldn't be double-taxed (which Trump has now eliminated). If we hear a loud rumbling noise this Christmas season, it's Lincoln rolling over in his grave."" Said Richard Norton Smith, former executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum: ""It is a curious claim, considering the first income tax and military draft was necessitated by the American Civil War, not to mention the suspension of Habeas Corpus and the ultimate expansion of government power -- to decree an end to slavery and then write it into the Constitution via the Thirteenth Amendment. I guess, then, you could call Abraham Lincoln a 'regulator of human rights.'"" At least one Lincoln scholar found some basis for Trump's claim: Allen Guelzo, professor and director of the Civil War Era Studies Program at Gettysburg College, said: ""...The Homestead Act, by selling-off large portions of the public lands, shrank the operations of the Federal Land Office over time. As the war drew to a close in 1865, Lincoln was extremely eager to begin a build-down of the regulatory apparatus created by the war-effort, and indeed, in terms of the federal budget, that shrank considerably between 1865 and 1871 from $1.9 billion to $424 million."" Guelzo also noted that Lincoln replaced 1100 of 1500 federal officeholders under his control; he said Trump was probably thinking of the number of ""regulators"" Lincoln displaced. We are not convinced, though, that this is what Trump meant, and it is not clear how Lincoln could be ""right up there"" given the tiny size of the government at the time. ""The body of federal regulations in 1861 was a very small one,"" Guelzo said. ""Most regulatory powers were exercised either by state governments or within the U.S. Military.

1061,1-16-2018,Twitter,"""Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled.""","Trump did not invent this false claim himself. Rather, he was citing his favourite morning show, Fox and Friends, which appeared to be citing the pro-Trump website Breitbart. But it was incorrect regardless. According to the polling firm Gallup, Trump's approval rating with Black Americans actually fell from 15 per cent to 6 per cent between January 2017 and December 2017, as the Washington Post noted. Recent polls from other firms put Trump's approval rating with Black Americans at a higher level -- 11 per cent in one poll, 12 per cent in another -- but still not even close to double his previous level. So where did Breitbart, Fox and Trump get this claim? They took data from the survey firm SurveyMonkey --  23 per cent Trump approval with black men, 11 per cent approval with Black women -- and simply averaged the figures for the two genders, settling on an ""approval rating"" of 17 per cent. Then they compared that 23 per cent number to Trump's 8 per cent performance with Black Americans in exit polls of the 2016 election. This is erroneous in two ways. First, you cannot properly compare approval rating polls to exit polls; exit polls do not show an approval rating but attempt to reflect how people voted. Second, it is bad math to take a simple average of a politician's male approval rating and female approval rating without considering how many of each were surveyed -- in this case, 19,000 Black men and 31,000 Black women. Trump's actual SurveyMonkey approval rating among all Black Americans.

He later explained that since additional time has elapsed since the campaign, he believes the total is now $7 trillion. That is incorrect.

Other key parts of Obamacare -- including the rules governing how insurers must treat people with health conditions; the expansion of Medicaid; the federal and state marketplaces on which people can buy insurance; the federal subsidies for many people buying insurance -- continue to function. Some analysts believe the death of the mandate will eventually lead to dire problems for the rest of Obamacare; a headline in left-leaning news website Vox read, ""The tax bill is the start of Obamacare collapse."" However, even here, Trump has his facts wrong: the reason the repeal of the mandate may endanger the rest of Obamacare is not because ""that's where a lot of the money came."" In reality, only a fraction of Obamacare funding is generated by the mandate. As the Associated Press reported: ""The fines on people who don't carry health insurance only provide a small fraction of the financing for the program. Most of the money comes from higher taxes on upper-income people, cuts in Medicare payments to service providers, and other tax increases.

But with Canada, the U.S. has a trade surplus when trade in goods and trade in services are both counted. Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers said as much in its annual report issued in February: ""The United States has free trade agreements (FTAs) with a number of countries -- some of which represent net trade surpluses for the United States (Canada and Singapore)...In 2016, the United States ran a trade surplus of $2.6 billion with Canada.""

While the U.S. trade deficit with Canada in the trade of goods alone grew larger in 2017, going from $11 billion in 2016 to $17.6 billion, trade in services, for which 2017 data was not immediately available in early 2018, almost certainly continued to give the U.S. a substantial net surplus.",Canada deficit,Yes,https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/970626966004162560,Canada,Trade,NAFTA,Exaggeration,Twitter

The non-biased reason the investigation began was confirmed in the Trump-endorsed memo produced by House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, a Republican: it was not out of a desire to discredit Trump but because of troubling information the FBI had received about campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos. Reports in the New York Times and elsewhere have revealed that Papadopoulos had boasted to an Australian diplomat that Russia had obtained damaging information on Clinton, before this was publicly known; the Australian diplomat had then passed on the information to U.S. officials. ""The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016,"" the Nunes memo says. With regard to Obama: even some members of the Obama administration take issue with Obama's quiet pre-election response to Russia's election meddling. It is certainly false, though, to suggest Obama didn't do anything at all.

Democrats have consented to billions in wall funding, but Trump has rejected even this deal on the grounds that he also wants the cuts to legal immigration.

Pruitt has argued that his arrangement was ""like an Airbnb situation"" rather than a traditional apartment rental, but there are almost no $50-per-night Airbnb options in that area of the city, and certainly none that allow the visitor to repeatedly book the same high-quality apartment at their convenience on short notice. While Environmental Protection Agency ethics official Kevin Minoli retroactively cleared Pruitt over the condo, saying that $50 per month adds up to a ""reasonable market value"" of $1,500 per month, he later issued a second statement saying he had not evaluated the ""actual use of the space""; the federal government's top ethics official, acting Office of Government Ethics director David Apol, then sent a letter to the EPA saying, ""Additional information has now come to light that calls into question whether the earlier determination that the administrator paid market value for the use he made of the apartment would still be valid.""

Four experts contacted by the Star said they were not aware of any estimate as high as $4 trillion for the amount of corporate profits not repatriated from overseas by U.S. companies. The U.S. Joint Committee on Taxation released an estimate of $2.6 trillion in August 2016, and experts said they were not aware of a massive jump in the following two years. (An October 2017 report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) pegged the number at $2.6 trillion, while Goldman Sachs pegged it at $3.1 trillion the same month.) ""Until there is some legitimate report showing otherwise, my guess continues to be that President Trump is arbitrarily inflating"" the accurate number, ITEP senior policy analyst Richard Phillips said in July 2018.

Trump was referring to a 60 per cent increase in overall coal exports; there is nothing ""clean"" about this coal. Even if one were to believe that there is indeed ""clean coal,"" a term that is the creation of industry spin, the term is not meant to be applied to all coal, which is how Trump uses it. The phrase, the New York Times reported, ""is often understood to mean coal plants that capture the carbon dioxide emitted from smokestacks and bury it underground as a way of limiting global warming.""

Centralia is not the only coal fire burning in the United States. In fact, it's just one of 38 burning in Pennsylvania alone. The hundreds of underground fires in the United States, from Pennsylvania to Alabama to Wyoming, combined with the thousands thought to be burning in China, India and elsewhere, are one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide and pollution on Earth."" And burning is not the only way coal can be damaged; E&E News, the energy and environment publication, reported in response to Trump's remarks: ""Frozen coal piles, for example, were cited as a major issue when a deep freeze hugged the northeastern United States in 2014, according to a report from federally appointed grid overseers.

However, as FactCheck.org, the Washington Post and others have explained, he was doing even this inaccurately. The president was simply taking the raw numbers in the GDP report -- $902.4 billion for the first quarter, $849.9 billion for the second quarter -- and subtracting the second-quarter number from the first, which gave a result of $52 billion. There are two problems here: these are not actually quarterly numbers; they are expressed on an annual basis. And they are not in today's dollars; they are expressed in inflation-adjusted terms. To do an accurate version of Trump's quarter-by-quarter comparison, experts told both outlets, you have to make sure you're using the current-day version of the figures; divide them by four, for the four quarters; and then, only then, do the subtraction Trump did right away.

We're starting to win lawsuits that we never -- you know that. We never won lawsuits because the courts are stacked. You know they -- it's sad.

First, it is false that WTO panels are ""stacked"": no judge on any of the three-judge WTO panels that adjudicate complaints can be from a country involved in the dispute -- so while the U.S. doesn't have a majority of judges, it also does not have a minority. Further, decisions by those initial panels can be appealed to the WTO's seven-member appeals body -- on which the U.S. has a judge. "" The United States, in fact, has always had one of the Appellate Body members with U.S. nationality, which is very unusual, but it is the situation,"" WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said in response to an earlier version of this Trump allegation. Second, it is false that the U.S. ""never"" won WTO cases before Trump came along; as his own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February, the U.S. has won 86 per cent of the cases it has brought to WTO adjudicators; the global average is 84 per cent, China's figure 67 per cent. (Other analyses have put the U.S. victory rate as high as 91 per cent). As is standard for the WTO, the U.S. tends to lose cases where a complaint is brought against it -- but even in those cases, Trump's advisers noted that it does better (25 per cent victory rate) than the world average (17 per cent) or China's record (just 5 per cent). Third, trade experts say there is no evidence the U.S. is now doing better at the WTO than it used to.

Hussein Banai, a professor who studies Iran at the international studies school at Indiana University, said in an email: ""The claim that Iran was on the verge of taking over the Middle East prior to Trump taking office is utterly false. In fact, quite the opposite was the case, as the Sunni-majority Arab states in the region -- most vocally led by Saudi Arabia and with the expressed support of the US and Israel -- had already begun to curb Iran's influence in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. There is no question that the perception of many of Iran's rivals in the region after the nuclear deal was that the Islamic Republic had emerged with a stronger geopolitical hand. But the reality was that Iran had merely emerged from nearly 40 years of isolation from which many of these rivals had benefited. So, I would say that the major grievance at the time was that the Obama administration had allowed for the Islamic Republic to become a 'normal' country.

It is not true that patients had ""no chance, no hope"" of getting experimental medicines. Rather, they simply had to ask the Food and Drug Administration for approval first. While many patients objected to this requirement, which the Trump-backed new legislation removed, the FDA approved 99 per cent of all patient requests, the Trump-appointed head of the Food and Drug Administration, Scott Gottlieb, testified to Congress in October 2017. The Government Accountability Office confirms: ""Of the nearly 5,800 expanded access requests that were submitted to FDA from fiscal year 2012 through 2015, FDA allowed 99 per cent to proceed,"" the GAO wrote in a July 2017 report. ""FDA typically responded to emergency single-patient requests within hours and other types of requests within the allotted 30 days."" Further, the new law will not help the patients whose requests for experimental treatments have been rejected by drug companies themselves, which Trump himself noted was a problem.

In fact, quite the opposite was the case, as the Sunni-majority Arab states in the region -- most vocally led by Saudi Arabia and with the expressed support of the US and Israel -- had already begun to curb Iran's influence in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. There is no question that the perception of many of Iran's rivals in the region after the nuclear deal was that the Islamic Republic had emerged with a stronger geopolitical hand. But the reality was that Iran had merely emerged from nearly 40 years of isolation from which many of these rivals had benefited. So, I would say that the major grievance at the time was that the Obama administration had allowed for the Islamic Republic to become a 'normal' country. The issue was never Iran's military might -- its defense expenditures and capabilities are dwarfed by those of Israel and Saudi Arabia -- but the fact that it was on the verge of a major economic boom in a post-sanctions world.""

In 2017, the United States' GDP annual growth rate ranked in the bottom third out of more than 180 countries, according to data from the World Bank. The International Monetary Fund's projections for GDP growth rate for 2018 place the United States among the bottom half of about 190 countries.

But the reality was that Iran had merely emerged from nearly 40 years of isolation from which many of these rivals had benefited. So, I would say that the major grievance at the time was that the Obama administration had allowed for the Islamic Republic to become a 'normal' country.

Obama did mock Trump for Trump's campaign claims that he was going to bring back manufacturing jobs that had been outsourced to Mexico, saying: ""And when somebody says -- like the person you just mentioned who I'm not going to advertise for -- that he's going to bring all these jobs back, well, how exactly are you going to do that?
